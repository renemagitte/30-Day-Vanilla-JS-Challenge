    // You might think we can just do something like this:
      
        team[3] = 'Lux'; /* This will update BOTH team-array AND players-array! */

        console.log(players, team);
      
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    
    // one way        
        const team2 = players.slice(); /* usually slices out parts, but with no arguments it slices out entire array, leaving the original untouched. */

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
        const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
        const team4 = [...players];
    
    // or Array.from way
        const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
        const captain = person; /* This will be a REFERENCE! */

    // how do we take a copy instead?
        const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 12, number: 99 });
        /* 1st argument: {a blank array}, 
           2nd argument: object we want to copy, 
           3rd argument: {additions/adjustments} */

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
        const captain3 = {...person}; /* Does not exist YET */

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
